### Exercise 1
This should be fun since I haven't taken any math past algebra, and that was at least 10 years ago...

Sub-Exercise | Answer
---: | :---: 
a) | O(n^3)
b) | O(1/2n) => O(n) 
c) | O(sqrt(n)/2) * 8+i * 8+j) => O(sqrt(n)/2)) => O(n)
d) | O(log n * n) => O(n log n)
e) | O(n * n * n * 10+k) => O(n * n * n) => O(n^3)
f) | O(1^n) so... O(1)? Doesn't seem right at all...
g) | No clue... seems like O(n) or O(1) but doubt it...
